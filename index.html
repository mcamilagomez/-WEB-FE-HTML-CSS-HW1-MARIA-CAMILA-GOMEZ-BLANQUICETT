                As a dedicated Systems Engineering student, I am committed to achieving academic excellence and passionately advocate for the empowerment of women in the technological field. Serving as the president of the W-STEM group, I have honed my leadership abilities, developed strong project management skills, and fostered a collaborative environment that thrives on teamwork. This role has not only allowed me to lead initiatives that promote diversity in technology but also helped me cultivate a network of professionals and peers who are equally passionate about these goals.

                My academic and extracurricular experiences have fueled my deep interest in software development, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. I am proficient in programming languages such as Python, Java, and JavaScript, which I have applied in various projects ranging from web development to complex data analysis tasks. Additionally, I possess a solid understanding of database management and network administration.

                Beyond my technical skills, I am highly adaptable and capable of working effectively both in team settings and independently. I am constantly seeking opportunities for continuous learning, staying updated with the latest advancements in technology to ensure my professional development keeps pace with the rapidly evolving industry. My strong focus on personal growth, combined with a passion for technology and inclusivity, drives me to excel in all my endeavors.
